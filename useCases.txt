1) Create a local branch and then set your local to upstream remote. We can use current master branch to do so.

following commands can be used to achieve the same

#git branch -m main master - use only in case of merge of your current main branch with master
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/master master
git remote set-head origin -a
